            <p>
                My name is Joshua (Achumanzeh) Jong and I am a fullstack developer. I love creating user interfaces with
                user
                experience being the top priority. Hence, my love for minimalistic websites.I love fixing things, be it an
                electronic that is damaged or a bug. There is sense of satisfaction I get after debugging that is difficult
                to explain. I love software engineering just for the fact that I can see a problem and create an app or
                website that helps a lot of people. Personality wise I love working in my comfort space, though working with
                others has it's perks and all as I've worked with other devs before and I work well others. I'd still prefer
                to work in my space.

                    Started my freelancing journey with WordPress installing themes and plugins, do a little bit of
                    designing. Eventually I started doing debugging on WordPress websites. After learning HTML, CSS and
                    JavaScript started doing custom CSS on WordPress websites.
